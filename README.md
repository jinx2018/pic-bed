Picture bed for personal use, mainly in markdown notes/blogs. 

## Tools

## Usage

- With uPic client in Mac,using the address(with dns optimization) it automatically generrated in paste board each time you upload a image in this picture bed
- Without uPic, it is also ok
  - Correct usage: enter the root if image, right click and select `copy link address` ,like
    - `https://github.com/jinx2018/pic-bed/blob/master/uPic/Ra1qmo.png?raw=true`
  - Wrong usage: simple root of image won't work, like
    - `https://github.com/jinx2018/pic-bed/blob/master/uPic/Ra1qmo.png`
